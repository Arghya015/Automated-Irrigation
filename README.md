# 🌾 Smart Agriculture System (Arduino UNO)

An **IoT-based smart agriculture system** that automates watering using sensors for soil moisture, light, and rain detection.  
It activates a **relay-controlled pump** only in the **evening**, when **soil is dry** and **no rain is detected**.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Soil Moisture Sensor** — detects when the soil is dry  
- ☀️ **LDR Sensor (Digital)** — ensures watering happens only in the **evening**  
- 🌧️ **Rain Sensor** — prevents watering when it's raining  
- 💡 **LED Indicators**  
  - Green LED → Pump ON  
  - Red LED → Danger / Pump OFF  
- ⚡ **Relay + Pump** — automatic water control (Active HIGH type)

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. The system constantly monitors **soil moisture**, **light intensity**, and **rain detection**.  
2. If:
   - Soil is **dry**,  
   - It is **evening (LDR = LOW)**,  
   - It is **not raining**,  
   then the relay turns **ON** the pump.  
3. The **Green LED** turns ON when the pump is active.  
4. The **Red LED** lights up if any condition fails.

## 🔋 Power Setup

- Arduino UNO powered via USB or 5V adapter  
- Relay and pump powered via 5V (common ground with Arduino)  
- If pump requires >5V, use **external supply + transistor driver circuit**
